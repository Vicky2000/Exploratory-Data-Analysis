#Exploratory Data Analysis

##Project 1

This is my repository for the the course "Exploratory Data Analysis" (MOOC format) on Coursera. Currently there are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts ('.R' files) to generate each.

To run this script kindly do the following:

  Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
  Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
  Extract the data into ./Data subdirectory;
  Run the scripts
